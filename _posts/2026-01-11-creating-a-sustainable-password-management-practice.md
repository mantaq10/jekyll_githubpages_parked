AI's most likely risk to hit us all may not be jobs displacement or power concentration at the hands of few. Its going to be cyber attack on both us and the service providers we use. AI and agents have significantly increased both the number of attacks on systems, thouhg there is adversity from within our corporatations as well. Last year, Cory Doctrow published his latest book Enshitification which has now entered our parlace quicker than just a fad. It refer to the predictable decline of online platforms over time. It may not be intentional though as demands to ship code faster has carelessly led to adoption of vibe coding without guardrails, let alone a clear understanding or competence among coroporations on how to safely utilise it, our systems are now more exposed than ever. And at the heart of it is our data that gets processed and preserved in these systems. The amount of data breaches and online identity theft is on a staggering rise and we all are impacted one way or the other. 

A decade ago, Cryptography expert Bruce Schneier wrote 'Data & Goliath' and made the point that corporate surveillance is far greater than government surveillance even when he was one of the key people collaborating with Glen Greenwald to analyse the NSA files Edward Snowden leaked. The concern, he mentions is that institutions, both public and private are teaming up on surveillance instead of ramping up on security. Known vulnerabilities are left in systems to be able to spy onto others rather than create an environment where everyone gets more secure. In light of this, the new AI developed systems are generating code that is hard to comprehend for humans and it is a high likelihood that critical oversight will be missed as we get more used to them. While these AI capabilities are improving, the mantra 'They work most of the times' doesn't work for securing our data as the chain is strongest as the weakest link in the chain.
