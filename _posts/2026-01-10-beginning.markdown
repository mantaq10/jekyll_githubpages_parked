Personal security ranks high in responsibility, especially for IT professionals like you handling sensitive data in locations such as Karachi. It covers both digital threats, aligning with your cybersecurity interests, and physical risks in urban Pakistan. Prioritising it reduces vulnerabilities from cyber attacks to street crime.[1]

## Digital Security Essentials
Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all accounts, including email and development tools, as it blocks most takeover attempts. Use a password manager like Bitwarden, which you've explored, for unique, strong passwords across services. Keep software and devices updated, validate inputs to prevent exploits like XSS or SQL injection in your web development work, and avoid public Wi-Fi without a VPN.[1][2][3]

## Physical Security Tips
Stay aware of surroundings in Karachi by sticking to main roads, varying routes to avoid predictability, and keeping car doors locked with windows up. At home, check doors/windows before bed, use peepholes, and avoid sharing plans publicly. Carry a cheap decoy phone/wallet for muggers and trust instincts to disengage from strangers quickly.[4][5][6]

## Quick Self-Audit
- Review app permissions and browser extensions regularly.[1]
- Monitor accounts for breaches and separate work/personal devices.[7][1]
- Test air-gapped backups for critical data, building on your prior interest.[8][7]
