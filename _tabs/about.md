## Where I am coming from?

Writing is thinking. Writing in public is yearning for connection amongst the vast emptiness of noise. It is a call to action to escape the void; though it is an effort in hubris to self-preserve, it offers a chance, albeit the rarest of chances, that when all is forgotten and forged in a digital pile of graves, you and I witnessed us! 

I am an optimistic contrarion and believe that a better future while possible is not probable without our collective and deliberate efforts. Our shared humanity lies in our ability to collaborate together especially to restore our individual agency to withstand the assymetry that comes with the concentration of control and misalignment amongst people and resources. You will find ideas here that are out of the norms, at first might even seem complaining though I like to believe in seeing both flaws and opportunities and having fun along the way. 


## The mess I created
*The Noiseless Patient Spider* _By Walt Whitman_

A noiseless patient spider,<br>
I mark’d where on a little promontory it stood isolated,<br>
Mark’d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,<br>
It launch’d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,<br>
Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.<br>

And you O my soul where you stand,<br>
Surrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,<br>
Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,<br>
Till the bridge you will need be form’d, till the ductile anchor hold,<br>
Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul<br>

## Where I'm going

This poem is a metaphor on the human condition. From isolation, seeking a connection. The metaphor indicates what we strive for, flinging ourselves in different directions yet patiently doing so until one of the flings can hook us to some grounding. 

However, all the directions that we have treaded form a web of fulfillment and a nest to dwell in. I feel the poem is a life lesson to keep traversing in different directions and similar to the adage of connecting the dots backwards, this poem elaborates that every experiment and every quest forms an integral part of the whole. It is in our nature to seek and explore. We have an empty canvas of the universe that we can strive to fill with experiences, sublime.
