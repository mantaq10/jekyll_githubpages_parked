I love solving business problems often through solutioning data intensive systems and analytics. My key approach is meeting constraints and concerns through product and stakeholder management. I am a specialised generalist and an optimistic contrarian with key skills in tech systems and analytics. 

I have enjoyed diverse roles in data modelling, solution architecture, data engineering, machine learning, knowledge management and pre-sales. Through my personal and professional experience I have learned the following about myself:

I am good at identifying business problems, materialising early stage concepts into working prototypes and taking it through implementation, delivery and adoption. I can work with both product market fit (0-1) and scaling (1-100) challenges. I love building technical systems for business value generation. 

- I am people oriented and facilitate shared understanding
- I nudge teams to understand the ‘why’ and problem discovery before implementing
- I put attention to detail in technical matters though work within project constraints. 
- I love breaking down work into small increments with feedback loops for learning. 
- I love experimentation and observability as a fundamental way of working. 
- I love breaking things down into first principles and re-assembling them. 
- I make effective notes and visual artefacts for myself that others also cherish.
